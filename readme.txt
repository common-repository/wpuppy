WPuppy is software for automatically updating Wordpress Plugins, Themes and Core.

== Description ==

WPuppy is software for automatically updating Wordpress Plugins, Themes and Core.
This has been created especially for Wordpress Developers and Designer Agencies.

How does it work? WPuppy creates a backup and a snapshot, updates the components and creates another snapshot.
Then it compares the websites based on the snapshots and functionalities. When all is OK, all is ready.
When there is a difference, the website is rolled-back to its previous state and you are being informed about this.

You stop wasting time on updating websites and can’t be taken off guard by failed updates.
This allows you to spend your time more effectively on creating added value for your clients, rather than fixing things!

Go to [WPuppy.com](http://www.wpuppy.com/?utm_source=wordpress%20plugin%20directory) to sign up for a free trial!

== Installation ==

1. Request a new environment on [WPuppy.com](http://www.wpuppy.com/?utm_source=wordpress%20plugin%20directory).
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wpuppy` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. Use the Settings->WPuppy->Settings menu to generate a WPuppy key.
5. Go to https://yourdomain.wpuppy.com/ and enter your website details, found on the Settings page.
6. Voila! Your website is now ready to be up-to-date and protected by WPuppy!
