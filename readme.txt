WPuppy is software for automatically updating Wordpress Plugins, Themes and Core.

== Description ==

WPuppy is software for automatically updating Wordpress Plugins, Themes and Core.
This has been created especially for Wordpress Developers and Designer Agencies.

How does it work? WPuppy creates a backup and a snapshot, updates the components and creates another snapshot.
Then it compares the websites based on the snapshots and functionalities. When all is OK, all is ready.
When there is a difference, the website is rolled-back to its previous state and you are being informed about this.

You stop wasting time on updating websites and canâ€™t be taken off guard by failed updates.
This allows you to spend your time more effectively on creating added value for your clients, rather than fixing things!

Go to [WPuppy.com](http://www.wpuppy.com/?utm_source=wordpress%20plugin%20directory) to sign up for a free trial!

== Installation ==

1. Request a new environment on [WPuppy.com](http://www.wpuppy.com/?utm_source=wordpress%20plugin%20directory).
2. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wpuppy` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
4. Use the Settings->WPuppy->Settings menu to generate a WPuppy key.
5. Go to https://yourdomain.wpuppy.com/ and enter your website details, found on the Settings page.
6. Voila! Your website is now ready to be up-to-date and protected by WPuppy!
